# Bitmask-based-Lossless-Compression
Lossless compression using Bitmask and dictionary selection method. Features of Program  1) It develops an efficient bitmask-selection technique that can create a large set of matching patterns. 2) It develops an efficient dictionary-selection technique based on bitmasks. 3) It proposes a dictionary-based code-compression algorithm using the bitmask- and dictionary-selection techniques that can significantly reduce the memory requirement.
